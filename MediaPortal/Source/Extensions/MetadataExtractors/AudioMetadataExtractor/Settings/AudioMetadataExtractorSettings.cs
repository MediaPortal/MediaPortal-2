    /// <remarks>
    /// Some tagging formats (such as e.g. Vorbis Comments) support multi-value fields in a way that you can store multiple
    /// fields with the same name. If a track for example has two artists "Beavis" and "Butthead", you can store one field with
    /// the name "artist" and the value "Beavis" and a second field with the same name "artist" and the value "Butthead".
    /// Other tagging formats such as ID3v2.3 store multiple values in one field and use a separator character to separate
    /// multiple values. In the ID3v2.3 format e.g., the separator for the field with the name "TPE1", which is used to store the
    /// artists, is '/'. As a result, in the example above, you would store one field named "TPE1" with the value
    /// "Beavis/Butthead".
    /// Unfortunately, the separator differs from one tagging format to another. In ID3v2.4 for example, the null character is used
    /// instead of the '/'. Since there is no unique and correct separator, many tagging tools have started to use their "own" separator
    /// values. MPTagThat for example uses the semicolon (';') as a unique separator.
    /// If this value is set to true, the <see cref="AudioMetadataExtractor"/> will use <see cref="AdditionalSeparator"/> as an additional separator character for
    /// all multiple value fields and all tagging formats. Since, depending on the separator used, there may be values that contain
    /// <see cref="AdditionalSeparator"/> as a regular character, <see cref="UnsplittableAddditionalSeparatorValues"/> contains values, which are not splitted
    /// although they contain <see cref="AdditionalSeparator"/>.
    /// The standard value for this setting is true combined with ';' as <see cref="AdditionalSeparator"/> to make <see cref="AudioMetadataExtractor"/> behave
    /// like MP1 and MPTagThat.
