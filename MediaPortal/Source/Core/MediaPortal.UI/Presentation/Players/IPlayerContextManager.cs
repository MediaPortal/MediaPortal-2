  /// Media modules (like Audio, Video, Image, TV, Radio) can initiate and access player contexts,
  /// which are specially connected to them. The player context manager service manages all those player contexts,
  /// tracks their player state and manages UI workflow states relating to active players.
  /// The transfer of the responsibility for the UI workflow state tracking from the actual media module to the
  /// player context manager is necessary, because players also need to run while the
  /// media modules possibly don't have the active control over them, maybe when players are running while the
  /// user navigates in the main menu.<br/>
  /// The typical separation of roles is like this:<br/>
  /// The media module initiates one or more player contexts. It doesn't need to track its player contexts;
  /// it is always possible to find the player contexts of the media module by its media module id (by calling
  /// <see cref="GetPlayerContextsByMediaModuleId"/>).
  /// The player context manager will track two current media workflow states for each player context: The workflow
  /// state for a "fullscreen content" state and the workflow state for a "currently playing" workflow state.
  /// The meaning of those two states should be complied to but the media module is responsible to provide appropriate
  /// workflow states.
  /// The player context manager will automatically switch workflow states, if necessary
  /// (for example when the primary and secondary players are switched, the fullscreen content workflow state needs
  /// to be exchanged if different fullscreen content workflow states are used for primary and secondary players).
  /// It will also automatically pop those workflow states from the workflow navigation stack, if the corresponding
  /// player context gets closed.
  /// The player context manager tracks player context activity states (like <see cref="IsAudioContextActive"/> and
  /// <see cref="IsPipActive"/>), takes care of automatic playlist advance and closes player contexts automatically,
  /// if necessary.
  /// Media modules should use this service interface to manage players which are integrated into the main UI instead
  /// of using the basic <see cref="IPlayerManager"/> API itself. If there are special needs, for example a video wall
  /// with more than two players or if players are needed with a different concurrentcy concept, the player manager's
  /// API can be used directly; in that case, all management beyond the basic player manager's functionality must be
  /// done by the module which directly uses the player manager's API.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// <b>Functionality:</b><br/>
  /// Built on the functionality of the <see cref="IPlayerManager"/>, the player context manager presents a more
  /// high view for the client, it deals with two (primary and secondary) typed player contexts and their playlists.
  /// The functionality of this component is comprehensive, it deals with the collectivity of all players, in contrast
  /// to the <see cref="IPlayerManager"/>'s functionality which is mostly focused to single technical player slot controllers.
  /// This service manages and solves player conflicts (like two audio players at the same time) automatically by
  /// simply closing an old player when a new conflicting player is opened. Non-conflicting players (e.g. video
  /// players) can be played concurrently.
  /// The technical target player slot (primary/secondary) of a given <see cref="IPlayerContext"/>
  /// is managed almost transparently for the client. There is a rare number of cases where the client needs to cope
  /// with the set-up of primary and secondary players directly, for example when two video players are running,
  /// one of them as PiP player. In that situation, it can be necessary to explicitly exchange the player slots.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
