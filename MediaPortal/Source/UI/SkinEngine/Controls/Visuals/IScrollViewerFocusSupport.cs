  /// It replaces the typical <c>IScrollViewer</c> interface which is used in WPF,
  /// where a mouse is available to support a manual scrolling. In MediaPortal, scrolling is not supported
  /// in that way it works in those libraries. Here, scrolling takes place as a result of focus
  /// movements. Implementors of this interface provide the functionality to scroll not only
  /// with the normal arrow keys, but also by focus movement of a complete "page" and by moving the focus
  /// to the "home" position or to the "end".
  /// This interface is related to the <see cref="IScrollViewerFocusSupport"/> interface.
  /// <see cref="IScrollInfo"/> contains the extended focus movement methods, which are
  /// only indirectly related to scrolling, while <see cref="IScrollInfo"/> contains methods directly
  /// related to the scrolling. Typically, both interfaces are implemented by scrollable controls.
