  /// to impersonate a thread and thereby make sure to have sufficient privileges to access that
  /// resource.
  /// The implementation of this interface provides the possibility to register credentials that
  /// can be used to impersonate for getting access to a particular resource. Based on the registered
  /// credentials, a caller can check whether it is necessary to impersonate for accessing a
  /// specific resource and, if so, impersonate with the right credentials.
  /// Starting an external process that needs access to a protected resource is particularly
  /// difficult because the new process needs to be started with the right credentials; an
  /// implementation of this interface therefore also provides methods to start external
  /// processes in a way that they have access to a specific protected resource.
