# Multiplatform roadmap

The plan of record for turning MP2 into a Windows/Linux/Android media centre. It is deliberately
short on vision and long on numbers, because every claim below is reproducible with a command in
`scripts/ci/` and every target has a number attached to it. Background documents that explain the
reasoning live next to this file:

- [Multiplatform-Assessment-and-Plan.md](./Multiplatform-Assessment-and-Plan.md) - what the tree looked like before anything was touched.
- [SkinEngine-Multiplatform-Proposal.md](./SkinEngine-Multiplatform-Proposal.md) - why the old skin engine is being replaced rather than ported.
- [New-Media-Center-Feasibility-and-Blueprint.md](./New-Media-Center-Feasibility-and-Blueprint.md) - the "write a new front end against the ported back end" option, and its risks.
- [P2-New-Frontend-on-Ported-Backend-Plan.md](./P2-New-Frontend-on-Ported-Backend-Plan.md) - the frontend plan that Phase 2 below now implements.

Decisions that are settled and should not be reopened:

| Question | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Target frameworks | .NET 10 only. No .NET Framework, no dual TFM, no `net48` compatibility shim. |
| Architecture | x64 only. No x86 (the remaining 32-bit pins are listed in Phase 1e). |
| Frontend | Avalonia + CommunityToolkit.Mvvm. The MP2 skin engine is replaced, not emulated; skin compatibility is accepted breakage. |
| Player | LibVLC or MPV via .NET bindings, video surface embedded in an Avalonia control. DirectShow is retired. |
| Deleted, not ported | SlimTv service layer, TvMosaic, and (still pending) ScimoreDB and SQL CE. |

## Where the tree stands

Verified 2026-10-18 with `build.ps1 -Solution Server,Client -Ratchet`, `tests.ps1`, `packages.ps1`,
`test-canary-linux.ps1` and `test-server-linux.ps1`:

| Measurement | Value | How to reproduce |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server solution compiles on Windows | 0 errors, 685 gated findings | `build.ps1 -Solution Server -Ratchet` |
| Client solution compiles on Windows | 0 errors, ~2460 findings (not gated) | `build.ps1 -Solution Client` |
| Server solution compiles **on Linux** | 0 errors | `test-server-linux.ps1` |
| Portable-core WinForms / GDI+ references | **0** (86 quarantined in 6 satellite files) | `spine.ps1`, `satellites.ps1` |
| Portable-core P/Invoke declarations | **95** in 13 files, invisible to `CA1416` | `spine.ps1` (P/Invoke column) |
| `CA1416` call sites, Windows vs Linux | 196 on both - identical inventories | build log, `warnings.ps1` |
| Unit tests, Windows | 4/4 suites, 262 tests, 0 failed | `tests.ps1` |
| Unit tests, Linux (canary) | 20/20 | `test-canary-linux.ps1` |
| Built executables are 64-bit | 5/5 apphosts measure `x64`, managed side `MSIL` | `architecture.ps1` |
| 32-bit declarations in source | 0 in SDK-style projects, 42 in old-style ones | `architecture.ps1` |
| Packages with known advisories | **0** (was 5: 1 critical, 3 high, 1 moderate) | `packages.ps1 -FailOn Low` |
| Packages via .NET Framework fallback | 7 | `packages.ps1` |
| Clean machine can restore | **no** - 6 package ids exist nowhere reachable | CI README, "The dependency closure is not reproducible" |

The client's finding total is written with a tilde on purpose: it includes the restore-time NuGet codes
that are deliberately outside the ratchet, so it moves by a few between runs of identical source. The
gated server number is exact because the codes it counts are functions of the source.

The last row gates everything else: nothing builds reproducibly on a clean agent or a container until
those six ids have a home. That is why it is Phase 1a and not a footnote.

## Phase 1 - backend that runs everywhere

**a. Give the six unreachable packages a home.** `BASSCombined`, `BassRegistration`, `BASS.NET`
2.4.14.1, `MediaPortal.TagLib` 2.3.1, `ffmpeg` 3.4.2 and `OnlineVideos.Core` 2.1.0 resolve only from
`https://www.myget.org/F/mediaportal/`, which answers HTTP 500 on package lookup. Verified with an
empty `-p:RestorePackagesPath`: `NU1101` for the ids nuget.org does not carry at all, `NU1102` for the
two it carries only in older versions. Order of attack: rebuild the two small ones that are MP2's own
(`MediaPortal.TagLib`, `OnlineVideos.Core`) and push them to a feed we control or a local folder;
vendor `ffmpeg` and the BASS binaries as a checked-in feed after their licence terms are read. Gate: a
restore with an empty packages folder and `-p:RestoreSources` limited to nuget.org plus that folder.

**b. Kill the advisories - done 2026-10-18.** What was there, and what closed it:

| Severity | Package | Version | Projects | Advisory | Closed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | `System.Drawing.Common` | 5.0.0 | 1 | GHSA-rxg9-xrhp-64gj | transitive, went with `DotNetZip` |
| Moderate | `log4net` | 2.0.14 | 104 | GHSA-4f7c-pmjv-c25w | bumped to 3.5.0 |
| High | `Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility` | 7.0.1 | 1 | GHSA-555c-2p6r-68mm | reference deleted |
| High | `System.Data.SqlClient` | 4.8.5 | 1 | GHSA-98g6-xh36-x2p7 | transitive, went with it |
| High | `DotNetZip` | 1.15.0 | 1 | GHSA-xhg6-9j5j-w4vf | reference deleted |

`packages.ps1 -FailOn Low` now exits 0 across 115 projects, which is the gate for this item. Three
notes that outlive the fix. `log4net`'s advisory is patched only from 3.3.0, so the bump had to be a
major-version jump - possible because the whole of MP2's log4net surface is one file, and now guarded by
tests that configure the shipped server config file, because an appender that stops resolving by name is
dropped silently and the product just stops writing logs. `DotNetZip`'s traversal has no patched release
of that package id at all, so `LogCollector` writes its archive with `System.IO.Compression` (verified
against a real log tree, same entry layout). And `Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility` turned out to be
exactly what it looks like: `Setup\Tests` imported none of the namespaces it supplies, nothing in the
tree needed `System.Data.SqlClient` - MP2's database access is SQLite - so both highs were two deleted
lines rather than a migration.

The `log4net` work is also what surfaced the tree's sharpest test trap, written up in the CI README
under "What decides the log level": the logger constructor applies the level from the settings service
over the configuration file, and `ServiceRegistration` is a process-wide singleton, so a test's result
depends on which fixtures ran before it.

Seven more packages still run through the .NET Framework compatibility path (`BASS.NET`,
`BassRegistration`, `MediaPortal.TagLib`, `SharpLibHid`, `DiscUtils`, `OnlineVideos.Core`,
`WorldWeatherOnlineHelper`). `SharpLibHid` is Windows input by nature and belongs in a satellite or in
the bin; `DiscUtils` has .NET-targeted builds.

**c. Replace the remaining Win32, registry and path assumptions.** The inventory is `CA1416`: **196
findings**, and the Windows and Linux inventories are identical for 35 of 38 codes, so this is one
list rather than two. 17 of the 196 are WinForms members in `MP2-Server`'s own `MainForm.cs` and
`ApplicationLauncher.cs` - a Windows tray host that should become a satellite instead of being
"fixed".

The analyzer is not the whole inventory, and one number proves it: with the portable core reading
**0** spine references, it contains **95 `[DllImport]` declarations in 13 files**. `CA1416` does not
report P/Invoke at all and P/Invoke is neither WinForms nor GDI+, so `spine.ps1` now counts them in a
third column, gated by the same "core may not grow, and a satellite may only grow by what the core
shrinks" rule.

The first candidate to lose its `-windows` target is `MediaPortal.Utilities`, and the work was
measured rather than estimated: with the TFM and `UseWindowsForms` changed by hand the project
compiles with 0 errors and shows 35 `CA1416` sites in six files (13 registry, 8 named-pipe ACL, 8
mutex ACL, 3 `HKCR`, 3 WMI, 1 `ApartmentState`). Two files already have their fallback written:
`ThreadingUtils.RunSTAThreaded` and `MimeTypeDetector.GetMimeTypeFromRegistry`, both guarded by
`OperatingSystem.IsWindows()` - the form of the branch that `CA1416` understands, which is what makes
the guard checkable. Registry and WMI use outside those, `Environment.SpecialFolder` assumptions and
GDI+ stay at the platform-service seam, not inside the core. Gate: the `CA1416` floor goes down,
`spine.ps1` stays at 0 in both of its columns, and `-p:WarningsAsErrors=CA1416` is added to a project
the moment that project reaches zero.

**d. Database that is not Windows-shaped.** Decide Firebird's future, verify SQLite as the primary
store on Linux (native binaries per RID, no `System.Data.SQLite` interop surprises), delete ScimoreDB
and SQL CE. Gate: `test-server-linux.ps1` grows from "compiles" to "runs" - the server creates a
database in a container, imports a fixture library and answers a query.

**e. x64 only - done 2026-10-18, except the installer.** The gate written here ("no `x86` in any
project file") was the wrong test, and finding that out was the useful part: 42 of the 60-odd
declarations are in old-style projects that cannot produce a `net10.0` output at all, while the one
place that really built 32-bit - `MP2-ServiceMonitor.sln`, which maps its `x86` and `Test` platforms to
project configurations with `<PlatformTarget>x86</PlatformTarget>`, and the project's own
`$(Platform)` default of `x86` - was invisible to a search for `Prefer32Bit`.

Removed: the x86 configuration groups in `MediaPortal.Server` and `MediaPortal.ServiceMonitor`, the
`Prefer32Bit=true` on the `AnyCPU` groups of `MediaPortal.Server` and `MediaPortal.Client` (that pair
was what actually made the shipped processes 32-bit on .NET Framework), `<LargeAddressAware>` from both
executables, the ServiceMonitor platform default, and 24 mappings in `MP2-ServiceMonitor.sln`, which now
aliases x86 and Test to `Any CPU` as every other solution in the tree already did.

`Gate:` `architecture.ps1`, which reads the PE `Machine` field of every built apphost rather than the
project files - all five measure `x64` with a managed side of `MSIL`, and it fails if a future SDK-style
project declares 32-bit again. Its first run found a sixth executable that did not exist: the
`bin\Debug\net6.0-windows` output folder the ServiceMonitor stopped using at the retarget is still on
disk, and both rows measured `x64` so the table was right by luck. Rows now carry their write time and
older duplicates are marked `stale`, because 442 pre-retarget output directories are still lying around
and any inspection of build output that does not ask *when* is inspecting the disk, not the source.

Still open, recorded by the same script so it stays visible: the installer chain
(`MP2BootstrapperApp`'s `RuntimeIdentifier win-x86` plus the four WiX projects that really build x86).
A managed bootstrapper application has to match `burn.exe`'s bitness, so the host RID cannot move on its
own; it moves together with the packaging, in a change that has to be verified by running a setup on a
machine with WiX installed.

**f. The API the new frontend consumes.** The client reaches the backend through in-process service
contracts. Phase 2 needs the same contracts over a real endpoint. Gate: an end-to-end call from a
separate process to a server on Linux returning a real library item.

## Phase 2 - Avalonia front end

Not started. Sequence that keeps risk visible:

1. Headless spike: an Avalonia window implementing the ten-foot navigation model (D-pad focus, no
   mouse) that runs on Windows and in a Linux container on the software renderer. No MP2 code yet -
   this proves the focus model and the CI story first.
2. Bind the existing platform-neutral ViewModels without change. Anything importing
   `MediaPortal.GUI.Library` is a View, not a ViewModel, and gets rewritten.
3. Configure the renderer per OS: DirectX on Windows, Metal on macOS/iOS, Vulkan/Skia on
   Linux/Android - each proven by a probe like `Dockerfile.drawing`, none assumed.
4. Skin engine replacement. The skin XML model gets no Avalonia equivalent; the migration story for
   users is that the new UI ships its own themes.

Gate: the client stops being WinForms, the satellite list in `spine.ps1` shrinks, and a screenshot
from a Linux container is in the commit that closes the phase.

## Phase 3 - player engine

DirectShow and its filters are Windows-only, not buildable here (no C++ toolchain) and unmaintained.
LibVLC or MPV via .NET bindings, video surface embedded in an Avalonia control, hardware decode through
the player (DXVA2 / VAAPI / VideoToolbox) rather than through MP2. `EVRPresenter`, EVR and DirectVobSub
die here. Gate: the same file plays on Windows and on Linux through the same code path, and the deleted
projects show up in `spine.ps1` / `packages.ps1`.

## What cannot be verified without the user

Stated once so it does not have to be repeated per phase: audio passthrough and HDR on real hardware,
DVB/TvHeadend against real multiplexes, the feel of remote navigation, visual taste, and a 40 TB library
import. These need hardware and judgement that are not in this environment, and they are batched into
one hand-off checklist per phase rather than dribbled out.
