  /// ConnectionPool maintains a pool of open connections to a database. If a connection is requested
  /// from the pool, it tries to return an already opened connection from the pool. If no more connection
  /// is available from the pool, a new connection is instantiated, opened and returned. After usage, the
  /// connection has to be returned to the pool.
  /// A delegate may be specified, which is used to instantiate and initialize new connections. 
  /// A maximum number of open connections may be specified.
  /// This class is thread save. If a connection is requested from the pool, the maximum number of connections
  /// has already been instantiated but all open connections are currently in use, the requesting thread is
  /// blocked until a connection is returned to the pool. A maximum timeout may be specified. If no connection is returned
  /// to the pool during this timeout, a <see cref="TimeoutException"/> is thrown.
  /// The caller has to ensure that a connection is returned to the pool only once. The ConnectionPool does not
  /// check for duplicates, because there is no "ConcurrentSet" available in .NET, a <see cref="ConcurrentBag{T}"/>
  /// is used as backing store for a <see cref="BlockingCollection{T}"/>instead because this is the fastest
