    /// In general, a <see cref="ILocalFsResourceAccessor"/> should ensure access to the respective resource through all of its methods
    /// as of its instantiation. Access through <see cref="LocalFileSystemPath"/>, however, is particular in so far as the actuall access
    /// to the resource does not happen within the <see cref="ILocalFsResourceAccessor"/>, but other code first gets the <see cref="LocalFileSystemPath"/>
    /// and then accesses the resource outside of the <see cref="ILocalFsResourceAccessor"/>. Additionally, there are situations, in
    /// which the <see cref="ILocalFsResourceAccessor"/> cannot ensure that between accessing the <see cref="LocalFileSystemPath"/> and
    /// accessing the resource behind it, it is still possible to access that resource through the <see cref="LocalFileSystemPath"/>. This
    /// is e.g. the case for the NetworkNeighborhoodResourceAccessor, which requires impersonation. Impersonation is thread-affin. If the
    /// <see cref="LocalFileSystemPath"/> was read in one thread, but the access to the resource happens in another thread, the
    /// access to the resource would fail.
    /// Accessing and using the <see cref="LocalFileSystemPath"/> is therefore generally only allowed within a:
    /// <example>
    /// using(lfsra.EnsureLocalFileSystemAccess()
    /// {
    ///   [Access and use <see cref="LocalFileSystemPath"/> here]
    /// }
    /// </example>
    /// There are two exceptions to this general rule:
    /// - if the <see cref="LocalFileSystemPath"/> is only used for string operations and the resource behind it is actually not accessed
    ///   (such as e.g. if the string is parsed for a folder name to match a movie name); and
    /// - if the actual access to the resource happens in another (external) process
    ///   (in which case the external process must be started via <see cref="IImpersonationService.ExecuteWithResourceAccessAsync"/>).
    /// In both cases please add a comment why calling <see cref="EnsureLocalFileSystemAccess"/> is not necessary.
    /// This method may return <c>null</c>. Make sure you check for <c>null</c> when calling Dispose() manually or better use it
    /// in a using-block, which automatically checks for <c>null</c>
    /// </remarks>
