  /// <para>
  /// The workflow manager manages workflow contexts on a stack. Each workflow step/state/context
  /// is put onto the stack. The current workflow state composite consists of all the workflow states
  /// from the root of the stack to its top. Such a workflow state composite can be thought of as the
  /// menu line showing all navigation steps so far.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// Example for such a workflow state composite:
  /// <example>
  /// Home > Media > Artist 1 > Album 5 > Track 2
  /// </example>
  /// During the navigation, the workflow state composite is built up by selecting the appropriate menu entries
  /// or other controls in the GUI which trigger the state transitions.<br/>
  /// Workflow states can be attended by a workflow model. This gives the model the ability to
  /// be notified about state changes to do initialization and disposal tasks.
  /// In the example above, the <i>Home</i> state doesn't have a workflow model, and all following states are
  /// attended by the <i>Media</i> model.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// A more complex example is:
  /// <example>
  /// <b>(1) Home > (2) Settings > (3) Shares > (4) New share name > (5) Choose share provider > (6) ...</b>
  /// </example>
  /// In this example, the workflow states 2 and 3 are attended by the <i>Configuration</i> model, while
  /// the states 4 et seq. are managed by the <i>Media</i> model.<br/>
  /// To give the workflow models the chance to handle this state flow, there are several methods which
  /// will be called.
  /// In the example above, state 1 doesn't have an attending workflow model. So switching to state 1 doesn't
  /// trigger any workflow model methods.
  /// State 2 is attended by the <i>Configuration</i> workflow model, so here, method
  /// <see cref="EnterModelContext"/> will be called with the <i>Home</i> context as <c>oldContext</c> and
  /// the <i>Settings</i> context as <c>newContext</c>.
  /// State 3 is also attended by the <i>Configuration</i> workflow model, so switching to this state will
  /// trigger a call of method <see cref="ChangeModelContext"/> with the <i>Settings</i> and <i>Shares</i>
  /// contexts as arguments.
  /// State 4 is attended by the <i>Media</i> model. So when switching to this state, two method calls
  /// will take place: First, the configuration model will temporary be deactivated by a call to its
  /// <see cref="Deactivate"/> method with the <i>Shares</i> and <i>New share name</i> states as arguments.
  /// Second, the <i>Media</i> model will be invoked by calling its <see cref="EnterModelContext"/> method
  /// (same arguments).
  /// Switching to state 5 is similar as switching from state 2 to 3: Method <see cref="ChangeModelContext"/>
  /// will be called at the <i>Media</i> model.
