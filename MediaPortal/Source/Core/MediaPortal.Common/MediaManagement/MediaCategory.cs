  /// Represents one node of the media category hierarchy. Examples for media categories are "music", "audio drama", "other audio", all with parent category "audio" or
  /// "movie", "series", "other video", all with parent category "video". Metadata extractors are assigned to media categories. Media categories are structured in a hierarchy,
  /// i.e. if a media category is assigned to a share, all metadata extractors for that category and of all direct and indirect parent categories are applied to that share.
  /// </summary>
  /// <remarks>
  /// Note that media categories are modelled as objects which are held locally in an MP2 system; they are not shared across different MP2 systems attached to a server.
  /// The reason is, the hierarchy information of a media category is only needed on the same system of a share of that category, it isn't needed in other systems.
  /// Media categories other than the default categories are in general provided by plugins which also provide metadata extractors.
  /// So if such a plugin is registered on a special MP2 system, that system will be aware of that media category because
  /// the plugin is forced to register that category. Thus, shares of that system can be added with that category because the category is known in that system. Furthermore,
  /// that system will be able to resolve the set of metadata extractors which are responsible for shares of that media category.
  /// For other systems, the category will just remain a string which is assigned to a share, without hierarchy information.
