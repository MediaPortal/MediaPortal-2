  /// An import job specifies a resource, a directory or a directory tree to be imported. An import job

  /// sub directories to be processed.
  /// In order to have consistent data to be persisted at each time, the importer worker will process for each directory
  /// its files first. After that, it will replace the current directory in the <see cref="PendingResources"/> by the
  /// collection of sub directories. So the job can be terminated or persisted at any time without the need to save more
