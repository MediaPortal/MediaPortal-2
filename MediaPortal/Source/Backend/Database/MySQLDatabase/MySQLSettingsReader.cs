  /// settings are very elemental for the server start. The XML file makes sense because of two reasons:
  /// <list type="bullet">
  /// <item>With this approach, we can provide a settings file which is already present before the first server start.
  /// That setting file can be filled with the actual DB settings before the server is started the first time.</item>
  /// <item>The MySQL settings don't need to be changed often. In fact, they will be edited once, at the first install.
  /// At this time, we have admin rights anyway, so it isn't a problem that the settings are located in our plugin directory.</item>
