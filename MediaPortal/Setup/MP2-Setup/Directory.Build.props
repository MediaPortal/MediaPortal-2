  <!--
  The MP2-Setup and MP2-Setup-NetCore projects both build to the same directory. In order to avoid
  that their build artifacts overwrite each other, notably the project.assets.json that lists the
  required nuget packages and other dependencies and usually gets placed in obj\, it is necessary
  to specify a project specific intermediate output path. This must be set before the SDK props for
  the project are imported, so is set here in Directory.Build.props, which is read first for all
  projects in this, and sub, directories.
