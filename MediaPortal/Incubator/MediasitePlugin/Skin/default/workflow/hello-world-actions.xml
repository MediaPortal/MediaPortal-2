    <!-- This is the workflow action which will be shown in the main menu in the home screen.
         A PushNavigationTransition is a static action which is always visible in one or more defined
         workflow states. When executed, the given target state will be pushed onto the workflow navigation stack.
         There are also other action types which can be used at this place, for example it is possible to
         make the action visible and invisible programmatically when using a workflow contributor action.
         
         The Id uniquely identifies the action among all workflow actions. Use a GUID generator to create
         a new action id.

         The action's name is only needed for debugging purposes and won't be shown to the user.

         The DisplayCategory is used to group actions together. There is no detailed definition which groups
         are present but the idea is that each plugin developer uses its own display categories to group its actions
         together. There are also some common display categories which can be reused here. Use the first letter
         as an indicator for the sort ordering, for example "z" for actions which should be posed at the end,
         "a" for the beginning, etc.

         The SortOrder is used for finer grained sorting inside a display category. We suggest to use a single, lower-case
         letter here.

         The SourceStates attribute is needed to tell the system in which states the action should be visible.
         Use the state's ids here, separated by ','. You can also use a star ("*"). In that case, the action will be
         visible in each workflow state.

         The TargetState attribute must always contain an id of a valid target state where the sytem will navigate to
         when this action is executed.

         The DisplayTitle will be shown in the main menu for this action. -->
