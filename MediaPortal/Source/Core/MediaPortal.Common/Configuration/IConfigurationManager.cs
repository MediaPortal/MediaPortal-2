  /// The configuration manager is responsible for finding all configuration items in the system and for
  /// organizing them in a configuration tree, build with <see cref="IConfigurationNode"/> instances.
  /// The tree contains <see cref="ConfigSection"/>s which are hierarchical organized. Each section may
  /// contain one or more <see cref="ConfigGroup"/>s or descendats of <see cref="ConfigSetting"/>.
  /// The structure is built-up by the <see cref="IConfigurationNode"/> instances, which themselves
  /// refer to the <see cref="ConfigBase"/> objects. So a node location can denote a section as well
  /// as a group or a config item.
  /// </para>

  /// To specify a location in the configuration tree, a notation similar to the unix filesystem is used.

  /// symbol of a location path, all further path elements are added, separated by "/" characters.
