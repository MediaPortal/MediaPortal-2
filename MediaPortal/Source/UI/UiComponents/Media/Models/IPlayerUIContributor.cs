  /// The media plugin provides a media navigation function for all kinds of media items (audio/video, all sub types like
  /// normal video, images, DVD, videos with sub title etc).
  /// We group all kinds of players by their AV-Type (all kinds of video players form the "V"ideo group and all kinds of audio
  /// players form the "A"udio group). All media items which are played by a player of the video group can be together in
  /// one single playlist and all audio media items can be in a single playlist.
  /// So, while advancing in a single playlist, multiple player types can be shown in a sequence; normal video players,
  /// image players, DVD players, subtitled players etc.
  /// All those players need special FSC and CP screens because they need to present different information and functions to the
  /// user (e.g. DVD players show buttons for the DVD menu).
  /// But because of the fact that all of those share a single playlist and thus are located in a single player context,
  /// all of them need to share a single FSC workflow state and a single CP workflow state. Those states are attended by the
  /// <see cref="VideoPlayerModel"/> respectively by the <see cref="AudioPlayerModel"/>.
  /// To make it possible that different screens can be shown per specific player type, there will be an implementation
  /// of this interface for each specific supported player type, which then is accessible via the <see cref="VideoPlayerModel"/>.
