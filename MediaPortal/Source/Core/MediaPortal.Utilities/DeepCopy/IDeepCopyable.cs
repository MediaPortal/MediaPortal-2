    /// {
    ///   base.DeepCopy(source, copyManager);

    /// It depends on the underlaying class, which actions have to be taken to correctly
    /// initialize the object state after the copying process. If the class uses
    /// change handlers for its properties for example, they should be detached as a
    /// first action in the <see cref="DeepCopy(IDeepCopyable,ICopyManager)"/> method,
    /// and be attached again as a last step. Other class natures perhaps need other
    /// treatments.
