  Contains a default key combination that can be used to start the client.
  To add any other key combination, copy this file to the config directory and edit it there. It is also possible to 
  edit this file directly where it's installed but it will probably be overwritten on the next update if you do.
  Possble StartCode types are "Remote", "Consumer" and "Keyboard". That and the comma separated list of keys part of 
  the combination needs to be determined first.
